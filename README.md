## Introduction

This README provides an overview of the CanSat NASA 2023 project. A CanSat is a small satellite system carried to the edge of space by a rocket and released to perform scientific experiments as it descends back to Earth. This project aims to document our CanSat design, data collection, and analysis process for the NASA CanSat competition in 2023.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: CanSat NASA 2023
- **Team Name**: VANDE
- **Event**: NASA CanSat Competition 2023

## Components

Our CanSat project consists of the following key components:

- **Sensor Suite**: Describe the sensors you've used for data collection, e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, GPS, etc.
- **Onboard Computer**: Details about the onboard computer or microcontroller used for data processing and transmission.
- **Communication Module**: How the CanSat communicates with the ground station.
- **Power Supply**: How the CanSat is powered during the mission.

## Software

- **Control Software**: Mention the software used for controlling the CanSat, e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Describe the tools and software used for data analysis.
- **Ground Station Software**: Mention the software used to receive and analyze data from the CanSat.

## Assembly Instructions

Provide step-by-step assembly instructions for building the CanSat. Include diagrams or images where necessary. Mention any specific requirements for assembly.

## Data Collection

Explain the data collection process during the CanSat mission. Include information about data sampling rates, storage, and any challenges faced during data collection.

## Data Analysis

Detail the data analysis process, including how collected data is processed, stored, and analyzed. Mention any software or algorithms used.

## Results

Summarize the results of your CanSat mission, including any significant findings, insights, or achievements. You can also include graphs or visual representations of data.

## Challenges

Describe any challenges encountered during the project and how they were overcome. This can include technical challenges, logistical issues, or unexpected obstacles.
